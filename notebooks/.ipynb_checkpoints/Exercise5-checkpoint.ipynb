    "If needed, download the data files ```nda_ex_5_*.csv``` from ILIAS and save it in the subfolder ```../data/```. Use a subset of the data for testing and debugging, ideally focus on a single cell (e.g. cell number x). The spike times and stimulus conditions are read in as pandas data frames. You can solve the exercise by making heavy use of that, allowing for many quite compact computationis. If you need help on that, there is lots of [documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) and several good [tutorials](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pandas-tutorial-dataframe-python#gs.L37i87A) are available online. Of course, converting the data into classical numpy arrays is also valid."
